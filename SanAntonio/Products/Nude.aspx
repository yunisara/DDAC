                        Initial fit should allow the foot to settle naturally into the sandal&#39;s foot bed so your foot sits inside the edge of the foot bed all the way around. The two front adjustable straps should fit comfortably on the foot once the buckle at the ankle is adjusted to a comfortable position.</p>
