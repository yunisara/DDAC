                        Pathfinder 40 is a classic design reintroduced from SAS archives for our 40th anniversary. Hand lasted to fit and follow the shape of your foot, Pathfinder utilizes our comfortable Genuine Moccasin Construction and SAS Tri-Pad® cushions for extra comfort and support. An unlined hand laced front with side perforations keeps the foot cool and dry. Hidden elastic prevents the padded tongue from slipping and the SAS EZ™ lace system makes for even pressure across the foot. With plenty of room for the toes and across the ball of the foot, this shoe has a relaxed fit. </p>
